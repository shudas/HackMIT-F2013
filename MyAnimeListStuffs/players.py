	Public attribute sets is a list of dictionaries with one-character keys

	Some interesting keys:
	
	c	process command name
	n	file name
	p	pid
	s	file size
	t	file type
	u	process user id

	The closest equivalent on Windows (for future porting) seems to be Handle
	http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx
	but that requires administrator privileges to run, does not ship with
